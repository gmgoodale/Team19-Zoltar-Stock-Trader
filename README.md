# Zoltar Stock Trader
## Product Vision

For tech savvy traders who want to use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in order to predict future performance of a single stock based on historical pricing data and capitalize on market opportunity in unprecedented ways. This approach will almost completely remove the human element from the trading process to increase individual profits by a margin unattainable by natural means. The Zoltar Stock Trader benefits from the use of widely available, open source DNN frameworks to create models for any individual stock. That leads to flexible software with a DNN backend that can be retrained for any individual or set of known stock price patterns. Zoltar will be usable by day traders and swing traders alike as it will function on charts from any time frame for which historical data exists. Traders who utilize this algorithm will be given the ability to automatically track their portfolio and focus on other things while the algorithm does it’s work. It’s primary functions will eliminate the need for the user to:

 1. Determine advantageous stock entry or buying points for all monitored stocks

 1. Determine a stop loss (percentage investment risk) for their position

 1. Determine a statistically reasonable return on investment and price target

Automatically place buy, sell, and short orders accordingly whenever a strong pattern or moving average is detected within the user designated time scale (ie: minute,hourly,daily, weekly, etc.)

Precedence for algorithmic trading currently exists in the market space. Companies like Barchart, inc. Credit Suisse, and Redline Trading Solutions inc. offer similar algorithmic trading solutions to those we will employ. The main difference between Zoltar and these algorithmic pattern trading approaches will be our use of DNNs to give our pattern recognition machine learning algorithm the power to recognize potential stock movement with precision more rudimentary approaches simply can’t.
