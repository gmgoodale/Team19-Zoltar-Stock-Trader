# Responsibilities

## Garett Goodale

### This Week
I will get the DataHandler and the model framework to interface directly. I will also start to modify the structure of the DNN to improve performance.

### Previous Weeks
I setup the framework for the DNN and built out the documentation.

## Kyle Sizemore

### This Week
I created functionality to allow the DataHandler to pass Numpy data directly to the DNN and setup unit tests for the DataHandler. I also updated the requirements section, created a new sequence diagram and created a Demo video.

### Previous Weeks
I setup the framework for the DataHandler, researched stocks of interest for the DNN and created a flow chart to describe the flow of Zoltar.

## James (Anton) Strickland

### This Week
I focused on expanding testing for the GUI; specifically button pressing, error handling, and timing UI hangs

### Previous Weeks
Expanded the UI to use containers and frames to expand scalability (which promptly broke nearly all tests)
