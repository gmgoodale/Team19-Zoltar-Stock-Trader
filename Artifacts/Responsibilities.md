# Responsibilities

## Garett Goodale [GitHub: gmgoodale]

### This Week
I will get the DataHandler and the model framework to interface directly. I will also start to modify the structure of the DNN to improve performance.

### Previous Weeks
I setup the framework for the DNN and built out the documentation.

## Kyle Sizemore [GitHub: KSizemore12]

### This Week
I opened up a noSQL server with amazon so that we can host zoltar's database online and create an executable later on without the hassle of moving a local sql database. This was a poor decision as it can get to expensive for me really fast. So we scrapped the database and are moving to storing our historical data locally in csv files. I added a function for this purpose.

### Previous Weeks
I created functionality to allow the DataHandler to pass Numpy data directly to the DNN and setup unit tests for the DataHandler. I also updated the requirements section, created a new sequence diagram and created a Demo video.

I setup the framework for the DataHandler, researched stocks of interest for the DNN and created a flow chart to describe the flow of Zoltar.

## James (Anton) Strickland [GitHub: Anton-Strick]

### This Week
I focused on bugfixing the UI, after updating MatPlotLib there were a few issues regarding some legacy functions being removed. Found an Icon to be used.
### Previous Weeks
Creating new UI diagrams as well as continuing to break the UI code to make it easier to call new pages.
